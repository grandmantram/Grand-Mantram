How can it be possible that when it comes to marriage, there is no talk of luxury? Marriage happens once in a lifetime, and not only the couple but also their parents and the
entire family have dreams about it. Now, when so many people are involved in planning a dream wedding, then a resort for wedding will be the only solution.

What facilities should be there in top luxury resort for wedding in Gurgaon?
If we talk about the best services, then there should be comfortable rooms for the guests to stay. There should be lush green gardens where you can celebrate your day ceremonies
amidst beautiful scenery and fresh air. There should be a beautiful ballroom for a sangeet ceremony. For a mehndi ceremony, a lovely swimming pool enhances the beauty of the decor
and the guests’ enjoyment.

For the final wedding ceremony, there should be a combination of a banquet hall and a garden. Whatever the weather, safety and beauty should go hand in hand. You shouldn’t face any
issues due to unexpected weather changes. On one side, dinner arrangements can be done in the hall, and on the other, a picture-perfect ambiance can be created with decor in the lawn.
The beauty of the wedding should shine under the stars.

What is the most memorable part of a wedding?

When selecting any resort for wedding for a family function, keep these four things in mind:

Location: The property should be on the highway so that it is easy for guests to reach.
Room Capacity: The property should have just the right number of rooms as per your needs. If extra guests are staying during your event, the resort might not remain flexible. 
Late-night celebrations followed by early breakfasts can be chaotic. Even other guests may face inconvenience due to loud music. So it’s better if the property is exclusive and
tailored to your requirements.
Variety of Venues: The resort should offer a variety of venues so that each of your events can have a unique look — and this variety will double the fun when it comes to decor!
In-House Services: Choose a resort that provides all services in-house — customized food, theme-based decor, bride and groom entry options, photographers, and entertainment. 
Because you’ll be so busy during your wedding, managing outside vendors will be one of the biggest tasks. Last-minute issues are hard to fix. A resort that handles everything in-house 
ensures smooth execution.
